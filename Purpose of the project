Many of us watched the Pinocchio movie when we were little that doll famous for lying. Fortunately for people in the world of stories they can detect Pinocchio lies by its nose that gets bigger when he lies, but what about our real world. People's noses are not too long when they lie, and at this time it is very difficult to trust people and assume that they are honest, especially when it comes to sensitive and important issues such as the investigation of a murder.
Lie detection is a major topic in psychology and law. Therefore psychologists have developed many tools and methods for discovering lies. These methods often included interviews and interrogations to try to uncover lies and uncover what the liar would not freely admit. With the development of technology in the twentieth century, psychologists and practitioners have developed various polygraph tools such as the Control Question Test (CQT), the Guilt Knowledge Test (GKT) or the Hidden Information Test (CIT), and advanced polygraph tests based on neuroscience . All of these tools depend on physiological indicators such as heart rate, respiration, and electrical conduction of the skin, depending on the fact that the involuntary responses of false individuals will differ from truth-tellers because they will be more tense. All tools face the same problem: no evidence uniquely linked to deception, like Pinocchio's growing nose. This is the reason why these devices are ineffective and intrusive. The results are not reliable and there are several known ways to cheat the test.
In the first century, with the development of artificial intelligence and neural networks technologies, interest in spoofing detection increased.

With this in mind, our project aims to develop a model that detects automatic speech spoofing while considering three different types of features such as network input, low-level audio features, phone stickers, and voice/audio features extracted at the phone level.
